### Notes

- To use the authentication api you need a valid token from google oauth client, the token is then sent to the Google oauth API to get the payload, which conatins the user's credentials. I only did it this way because saving passwords can be a drag, so you need a front-end that implements a sign in with google.
- This is api uses a cache aside caching technique on the trips endpoint. For information about caching techniques see [Caching Techniques](https://bluzelle.com/blog/things-you-should-know-about-database-caching#:~:text=Cache%20Aside,will%20retrieve%20the%20data%20directly.)
